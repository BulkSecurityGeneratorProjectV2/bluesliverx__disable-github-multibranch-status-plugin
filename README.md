# Disable GitHub Multibranch Status Plugin

This simple plugin adds a trait/behavior for the GitHub Branch Source plugin that can disable
the automatic notifications (commit status updates) sent to GitHub during a build.  This is meant
to be used in situations where status checks are manually done through other methods or
integrations.
